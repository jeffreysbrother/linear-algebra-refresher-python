#Linear Algebra Refresher

Fundamental objects: **points** and **vectors**.
A vector is an object that represents a change in position. In Euclidean space, a vector can be conceived of as an arrow connecting two points. A vector (in Eucliden space) has two important properties: magnitude and direction. Vectors do not have a fixed location; two vectors are equivalent if they represent the same amount of change in some direction.

###Operating on Vectors

To visualize the sum of two vectors (in a geometric fashion), imagine them as lying end-to-end. The arrow formed at the tail of the first and ending at the head of the second makes clear the overal amount of change of the two vectors. This is the sum of the first two vectors.

There is also a numeric interpretation of vector addition. We can add the corresponding coordinates of each vector. 

In order to visualize vector subtraction, position two vectors as emanating from the same point. What vector would we need to add to the bigger (the more severe or bigger or comparatively magnitudinous?) in order for the sum to be that of the smaller?
