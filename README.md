##Linear Algebra Refresher

Fundamental objects: **points** and **vectors**.
A vector is an object that represents a change in position. In Euclidean space, a vector can be conceived of as an arrow connecting two points. A vector (in Eucliden space) has two important properties: magnitude and direction. Vectors do not have a fixed location; two vectors are equivalent if they represent the same amount of change in some direction.
